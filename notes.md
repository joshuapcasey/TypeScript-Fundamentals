# Overview
- TypeScript was developed by Microsoft to bridge gap between JavaScript (originally a front-end scripting language) and Object-Oriented Programming languages (C# | Java | Python | etc)
- Meant to bring type safety into JS by enabling 'static checking' (real-time checking of datatypes)
    if expecting a number and attempting to pass in a string, will throw error
- TS is a typed superset of JS, compiles into plain JS, and supports all JS libraries

# Differences
- TS is known as an object-oriented programming language whereas Js is just a scripting language
- TS has a feature known as 'Static Checking'
- TS gives support for modules
- TS has interfaces while JS does not

# Advantages of TS
- TS always points out any compilation errors at the time of development. This means less errors at runtime
- With compile time error checking, our program won't run a single line of code until we remove all syntax errors
